# Comparative Analysis of NLP Applications Using RNNs, LSTMs, and Recursive Neural Networks

This repository explores the effectiveness of various neural network architectures for NLP applications, focusing on tasks such as hate speech detection, fake news detection, and sentiment analysis. The networks evaluated include:

1. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Bidirectional RNN
2. Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM
3. Recursive Neural Network (RvNN) and Bidirectional RvNN (custom implementations)

## Contents

- **Dataset**: Includes datasets for hate speech, fake news, and sentiment analysis.
- **Code**: Implementations of RNNs, LSTMs, and custom RvNNs in Python.
- **Evaluation**: Comparison of model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1 score (for classification tasks), and BLEU score (for translation).

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure Python environment with necessary libraries (numpy, tensorflow/keras, nltk, etc.).
2. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess datasets for specific tasks.
3. **Model Training**: Train RNNs, LSTMs, and custom RvNNs on respective datasets.
4. **Evaluation**: Compare results using provided evaluation scripts.
5. **Results**: Interpret and analyze performance metrics across different architectures.
